<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> Synopsis </p>

<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; padding-top:25px; line-height:200%; text-indent:10mm;">FreeMyNews is a application/website that provides high quality, non-partisan content based primarily in the United States. Over the past couple years, media in the United States has become extremely partisan to the extent that they neglect providing objective content and instead shamelessly promote their own particular brand or ideology. Even formerly reputable organizations such as the New York Times and the Economist Magazine have been affected by this notably regressive left-wing or alternative-right bias. 
</p>

<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; line-height:200%; text-indent:10mm;">The election of Donald Trump in the United States by nearly 50% of the voting bloc proved that there is a major vacuum of content that goes unheard and unreported. We would like to bring this content and differing points of view to the mainstream. Instead of following fringe Facebook or Twitter accounts such as Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos or websites like Drudge, users could download the FreeMyNews app as an alternative. Here we have original, thought-provoking content written mainly by exceptional students of Political Science/History/Journalism and by working professionals. It serves as an alternative to traditional media institutions such as CNN, Fox, MSNBC, Huffington Post... etc. In this day and age of mass communication and social networking, we should not have to rely on a few archaic, traditional outlets to tell us about the world. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Avenir Next'; line-height:200%; text-indent:10mm;">Every post on the app is in article format with the exception of the live-stream feature. This distinguishes us from Twitter and Facebook as legitimate and credible content as opposed to sensationalism and clickbait. With live-stream, which is available to any user, anyone can stream relevant content and act as a citizen journalist. Additionally, perhaps the most important feature of the app is that it automatically sorts content according to built-in criterion such as
author-credibility and article-rating. This means that only relevant high-quality content stays at the top of the feed and visible to the user.
